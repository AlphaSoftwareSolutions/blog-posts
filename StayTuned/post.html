<p>Nowadays is really difficult to be up to date with the latest technologies, concepts or tools. There are several ways to accomplish this. You could use RSS, check blogs regularly or follow as many people as possible in Twitter/Facebook. My way is to watch videos from various conferences.</p>[STOP]

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are few things, which I'm looking for while picking a conference to watch.</p>

<ul>
<li>speakers - I know a lot of good speakers and if I see them attending in an event I know that I have to check it. That's how I found the smart people. Usually the they are, or at least have something smart to say.</li>
<li>talks - I'm interested in tech talks, but not lectures with a lot of details. I prefer to listen for a new concept or some interesting use cases. If the slides are full with complex I feel a little bit bored and normally I move to the next speaker in the list.</li>
<li>only new stuff - there are a lot of screencasts out there. It is physically not possible to watch them all. I have a simple rule - watch only those clips which are captured this or last year. Of course I have exclusions, but in general I'm trying to stick to the latest videos. </li>
</ul>
