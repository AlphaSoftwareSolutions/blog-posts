# JavaScript: sequencing function calls 

While I'm working on [Auxilio](https://github.com/krasimir/auxilio) I end up in a sitatuation where I have to call few javascript functions in a sequence. It's an interesting how this could be solved and I'll be happy if you share your approach for such problem.[STOP]

[Auxilio](https://github.com/krasimir/auxilio) supports something which I call *scripting*. I.e. it allows the developers to write their own js scripts and run them in the context of Chrome.
